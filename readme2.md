**Project Overview:**

This project is a web application that allows users to explore and interact with a movie catalog. The catalog includes detailed descriptions and characteristics of movies, which are dynamically fetched via an API. Users can search for movies using a search feature, and the results are displayed through modular windows.

**Key Features:**

1. **Movie Catalog:**
   - The movie catalog consists of detailed descriptions, genres, ratings, and other characteristics for each movie.
   - All movie data is fetched from an external API, ensuring that the catalog remains up-to-date.

2. **Modular Windows:**
   - The content, including movie information, is displayed in modular windows. These windows are designed for flexibility and responsiveness, providing a smooth user experience.

3. **Search Functionality:**
   - Users can search for movies based on various criteria (e.g., title, genre, or rating).
   - The search feature utilizes an API to retrieve results based on the user’s input.

4. **User Profile:**
   - Users can view their personal information on their profile page.
   - Profile editing is not permitted; users can only view their details.

5. **Authentication and Registration:**
   - The system includes a registration and login feature to allow users to securely access their profiles.
   - Authentication ensures that only registered users can access certain features, such as subscribing to services.

6. **Subscription Service:**
   - Users can subscribe to gain access to exclusive content or features.
   - Subscription status is tied to the user profile and is checked upon login.
